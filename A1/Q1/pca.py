# label graphs clearly with x-axis and y-axis. 
# when writing report be as clear as possible

# to run pca on the algorithm.
# i. convert the dataset into column vectors. 
# ii. center the dataset. 
# iii. find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (you can use a library for this)
# iv. decide the number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors to take (represent 95% of the data)
# v. somehow show the images of the principal components : w_1, w_2 ... 
# vi.
